    * Durations define the amount of intervening time in a time interval and are represented by the format P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S. The [n] is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that follow the [n]. Leading zeros are not required. The capital letters P, Y, M, W, D, T, H, M, and S are designators for each of the date and time elements and are not replaced. P is the duration designator (for period) placed at the start of the duration representation. Y is the year designator. M is the month designator. W is the week designator. D is the day designator. T is the time designator. H is the hour designator. M is the minute designator. S is the second designator and can include decimal digits with arbitrary precision.
